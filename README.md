[![stable](http://badges.github.io/stability-badges/dist/stable.svg)](http://github.com/badges/stability-badges)Generic Algorithm for BP network optimization in Matlab

### The purpose of the Optimization
Although BP neural network performs well in handwritten numeral recognition, it can not be ignored that the weights and thresholds of BP neural network are initialized randomly, which is easy to lead to unstable fitting effect.
<br>Moreover, it is easy to make the training of weights and thresholds of BP neural network fall into local area because of gradient descent Optimum. So in this experiment, GA genetic algorithm is used to optimize the initial weights and thresholds of the neural network in the handwritten numeral recognition method based on BP neural network.
### The Process for optimization
<br>The snapshots are all pictured from my project reports

#### To strengthen the Robustness
Based on the total of 200 samples in datasets, I separate 180 of them as the trainins set,while the rests for testing.
<br>Here is the result.![The best result](https://cl.ly/17f733e95022/Image%2525202020-01-20%252520at%25252011.20.20%252520PM.png)
